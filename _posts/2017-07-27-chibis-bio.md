Last but certainly not least, what group would be complete without the Chibis??
Meet Sailor Chibi Moon, Chibiusa! Real life cousin of Chibi Chibi, Chibiusaâ€™s signature throws are Crochet hair bows and perler hearts. When she is not scolding Usagi, Chibiusa can be found painting and drawing and camping with her real life mom, Sailor Mercury!
Meet Chibi Chibi Moon, the Light of Hope and the original inspiration for Krewe du Moon's creation. Her signature throws are recycled transformation wands and scout bracelets. Her favorite activities are annoying Chibiusa and watching Sailor Moon with her mommy!
