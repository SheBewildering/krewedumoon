Meet KDM’s Sailor Pluto! Accurate to the manga/anime, Jacki is the tallest scout, towering over most of the dance troupe at 6’2”! Dancing and crafting are not her forte, but she’s full of enthusiasm and love when it comes to Sailor Moon and the scouts ❤️. When she’s not working on the Krewe’s social media profiles or guarding the Gates of Time, she works as a TV anchor for the ABC in New Orleans! She also enjoys playing sand or indoor volleyball, working out, reading/watching anime/fantasy/scifi and messing around on the synthesizer.
