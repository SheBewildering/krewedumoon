Meet Davina, Krewe Du Moon's Sailor Saturn! She loves dancing, cosplaying, and crafting in Krewe Du Moon. And as Mistress of Sound, she makes sure our music sounds great. Her specialty throws include crocheted crescent moon wands and sailor senshi gloves. When she's not watching Sailor Moon, you can find her watching Futurama and Voltron!
