Meet KdM’s Sailor Mercury, Renee!
Renee is a member of the Dance Committee and loves helping contribute to the choreography for the parades! Mercury’s signature throws are Crocheted Tiara’s, Ribbon Hair Bows, and Sailor Scout Garters. When Renee is not fighting the Negaverse, she can be found helping run the Climbing Program for the local BSA counsel, camping, and reading!
