Meet KdM's Sailor Uranus, Star! Star is the Dance Captain of KdM and works hard with the dance committee to come up with fun choreography for parades and performances! Her signature throws are Sailor Soaps and perler bows, and she's hoping to start working with resin for 2018 throws! When she's not flirting with all the ladies, she teaches high school science and is one of the head admins for the Hogwarts Running Club!
