Meet KdM's Sailor Moon, Caylie!
She assists Sailor Venus with organizing the group. Her signature throws are cross-stitched moon wands and sailor scout bows!
When she's not transformed into a warrior of love and justice, she enjoys reading fantasy and sci-fi books and taking care of her plants. And eating. Because cake.
