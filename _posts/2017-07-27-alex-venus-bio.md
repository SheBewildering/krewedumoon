Meet Krewe Du Moon's Sailor Venus, Alex! She's a cosplay enthusiast, dancer, and overall pop culture buff! Her signature throw is sailor sugar stars! When not suited up as the Pretty Guardian of Love, Beauty, and Hope; you can find her binge watching Netflix, designing new costumes, or playing some sport somewhere!
