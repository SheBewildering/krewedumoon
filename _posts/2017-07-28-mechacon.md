Krewe Du Moon will be at MechaCon 2017! This year's convention will be at the Hyatt Regency New Orleans July 28-30. We will have a fan table in the Artisan Market at location F09 where you can meet members of the krewe, see craft demos, and enter to win prizes!

We will also perform in the skit division of the MechaCon Cosplay Contest on Saturday, July 29. The contest will be held in the Celestin Ballroom. Seating begins at 2:00 p.m and the show begins at 3:00 p.m.

On Sunday, July 30, Krewe Du Moon will host a dance panel where you can learn one of our original choreographies! The panel will take place in Panel Room 2 at 1:00 p.m.

Can't wait to see you there!
