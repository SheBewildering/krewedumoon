Meet KdM’s Sailor Jupiter, Jacqui! She's our illustrious webmaster and keeps the KdM website running! Her specialty throws are copies of Sailor Jupiter’s own rose earrings. When she’s not showing off her moves on the parade route, she spends time building other websites and taking care of her dog, Blue.
