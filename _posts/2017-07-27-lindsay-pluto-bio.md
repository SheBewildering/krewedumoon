Meet MaraSpells, Krewe du Moon’s craft mistress! She joined KdM in its inaugural year as Sailor Pluto alongside Jacki, but be on the lookout for her debut as Sailor Mars at Mechacon 2017. Her signature crafts are ribbon wands, garnet rod keychains, tiara boomerangs, and perler pins. She’s got even more new ideas in the works for Chewbacchus 2018, but when she’s not crafting you can catch her watching horror movies, snuggling her dog Bigby, or playing D&D.
