We are a New Orleans-based, Sailor Moon-themed, dancing/marching subkrewe of the Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus. We are a cosplayer-friendly, anime-niac, and general Sailor Moon fangirl/fanboy group named for Sailor Moon in dedication to the original founders' unabashed love for the magical girl anime and manga. We dance and craft at our monthly meet-ups, march in Chewbacchus at Mardi Gras as well as in other parades throughout the year, and cosplay at local events.

Creed of Krewe Du Moon:

We will not judge members for only experiencing or *gasp* preferring the English-dubbed version as seen on Cartoon Network in the late 90s. We will endeavor to expose new Moonies and "Meatball Heads" to the joys of watching in the original Japanese format with subtitles and to reading the manga.

ANY-bent (gender/race/interspecies and crossover) -cosplay is always welcome.

This is a family friendly group. Our kids love to dress up just like we do, and in fact the idea for this group came from my Former Princess Leia's insistence that she WILL be "Chibi Chibi" from Sailor Stars.

If you love anime, Sailor Moon, or talking cats with crescent moons on their heads, check us out! We are fully costumed, throw-prepped and ready to roll with IKOC.
Many Members will also be seen at various Comic Cons indulging in all our geeky/nerdy/â€œComic Book Cutie" awesomeness!
