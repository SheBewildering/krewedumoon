We are a New Sub-Krewe within Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus this is a Cosplayer-friendly Anime-niac or general Sailor Moon Fangirl/ Fan Boy group.
Specifically named for Sailor Moon in dedication to the original founders' un-abashed love the the Kawaii drama Pretty Sailor Senshi Sailor Moon.

Creed of Krewe Du Moon:

We will not judge members for only experiencing or *gasp* preferring the English Dubbed version as seen on Cartoon Network in the Late 90s. We will endeavor to expose new Moon-ies and "Meatball Heads" to the joys of watching in the original Japanese format with fan-subs and to reading through the Manga.

ANY-bent (gender/race/interspecies and crossover) -cosplay is always welcome.

This is a family friendly group. Our kids love to dress up just like we do, and in fact the idea for this group came from my Former Princess Leia's insistence that she WILL be "Chibi Chibi" from Sailor Stars.

If you love Anime, or Sailor Moon (or talking cats with crescent shapes on their heads) check us out! We are fully costumed, throw-prepped and ready to roll with the IKOC. 
Many Members will also be seen at various Comic Cons indulging in all our Geeky/ Nerdy/ "Comic Book Cutie" awesomeness!
